The air smells of myrrh and milk. Two golden cradles sit side by side, but the mothers do not use them—not yet. Cleo reclines against plush cushions of lapis and ivory, her dark skin radiant with postnatal warmth. Her sheer linen robe is loosened, one full breast exposed, its light nipple darkened with milk. Nestled at it: a pale, delicate infant, pink-lipped and wide-eyed, drinking greedily. His tiny fingers clutch at her skin, his head resting like alabaster on obsidian. Across from her, Thea sits with one leg curled beneath her, moonlight catching her light skin and silver-streaked hair. Her robe has slipped from one shoulder, baring a heavy breast with a dark, full nipple that seems to pulse with life. Her son—rich brown skin, thick curls, and fists clenched even as he feeds—suckles with primal need.", lines: [ { speaker: "Cleo", text: "He latches like a scholar… eager, but precise.

No poetry, just hunger." }, { speaker: "Cleo", text: "Of course. The beast feeds like it’s a conquest." }, { speaker: "Thea", text: "And yours… like he’s been granted an audience. Careful not to spill a drop. So polite." }, { speaker: "Thea", text: "Good. He should be. He drinks from divinity." }, { speaker: "Thea", text: "So does mine.

It’s almost… poetic." }, { speaker: "Thea", text: "And yours—dark as night, but blooming pale where he feeds. Like the moon rising from the desert." }, { speaker: "Cleo", text: "A reversal. A reminder." }, { speaker: "Thea", text: "That we carry what we are not… and made them everything." }, { speaker: "Cleo", text: "Not everything.
